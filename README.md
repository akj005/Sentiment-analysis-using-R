# Sentiment-analysis-using-R
The project utilizes R's tidytext and ggplot2 libraries to analyze the sentiment in Jane Austen's book "Emma." The text is tokenized into words and processed to calculate sentiment scores based on a pre-built sentiment lexicon. The sentiment analysis is visualized using bar plots, showcasing sentiment distribution across chapters and individual words. Positive and negative sentiment words are counted and represented in a horizontal bar plot. Additionally, a word cloud illustrates the most frequent words in "Emma" based on their sentiments. Overall, the project provides valuable insights into the emotional tone of the book, uncovering the prevalence of positive and negative sentiments throughout the text.
